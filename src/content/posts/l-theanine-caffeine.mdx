## TL;DR
Pair your normal coffee with **100–200 mg L‑theanine** (informational range from studies) for calmer alertness. Keep your **caffeine cutoff ~7–8 h before bed**. If you want zero‑friction, use a high‑quality instant coffee for fast hot **or iced** coffee.

### Why this works
- **Caffeine** antagonizes adenosine → alertness.  
- **L‑theanine** (a tea amino acid) can smooth jitter and improve attention when paired with caffeine in several controlled trials and reviews.  
- Together they often feel “cleaner” than caffeine alone.

### How to try it (simple routine)
1. Make a **small/medium coffee**. Instant works great for speed; see pick below.  
2. Take **L‑theanine (100–200 mg)** with it.  
3. **Stop caffeine by mid‑afternoon** (adjust to your sleep).  
4. Track: focus (1–5), calm (1–5), and sleep latency.

### My convenient coffee pick
Swift Coffee’s instant dissolves quickly (even cold) and tastes like a legit pourover, so it’s perfect for quick iced lattes. (Affiliate link placeholder below—replace with your ID.)

### Timing guardrails
- **AM and early‑PM only** if sleep is sensitive.  
- If you still feel wired at bedtime, move the last dose earlier or reduce caffeine.

### Evidence snapshot (plain‑English)
- Reviews and controlled studies suggest **theanine+caffeine > either alone** for attention and task performance in healthy adults; emerging work explores ADHD populations.  
- Practical note: effects are modest but noticeable for many; sleep timing matters more than micro‑tweaking doses.
