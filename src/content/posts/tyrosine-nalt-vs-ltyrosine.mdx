> Educational only. Not medical advice. Tyrosine can interact with meds (esp. **MAOIs**) and may aggravate **migraine** in some—talk to a clinician.

## What tyrosine does
Tyrosine is a precursor for **dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine**. Some studies show benefits under **stress/cognitive demand**, though results are mixed.

## NALT vs L‑tyrosine (key differences)
- **N‑acetyl‑L‑tyrosine (NALT)** is a modified form marketed for “better absorption.”  
- Evidence to date **does not clearly support NALT being more bioavailable** than L‑tyrosine; some reports suggest it **may convert poorly** to tyrosine in humans.  
- Practical upshot: many evidence‑based products still use **L‑tyrosine**.

### ADHD‑aware notes
- Some people (like me) report that tyrosine **supports focus/motivation**, especially alongside stimulants—but this is **n=1** and not a treatment for ADHD.  
- **Migraine caution:** Tyramine (derived from tyrosine) can trigger migraines in some individuals; evidence is mixed overall but stronger for those on **MAOIs**.

## Choosing a product
- Look for **single‑ingredient L‑tyrosine** with clear amount per serving.  
- Skip proprietary blends; avoid mega‑doses.  
- If you’re using higher‑dose **zinc** routinely, discuss **copper** status with your clinician (zinc can reduce copper).
